- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeroen-v-g

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, in particulair in Java software development. I worked 20 years professionally in IT and have done some projects outside of my work scope. I have multiple public repositories, one called dogwatch containing a small web app that can be deployed as a docker container. The tool can be used to search for similair faces. And one called molenDB, this is a POC to see how angular can work together with spring in a single container. I did a third project for the food/retail industry which was a innovation tracker used to introduce new food products on the market this repository is private. Herunder some screenshots of the applications:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my full stack development skills with java and typescript.
